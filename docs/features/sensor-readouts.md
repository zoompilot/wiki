# Sensor readouts

Supported Mazdas carry sensors that the stock openpilot port ignores.
zoompilot wires them in.

## Forward radar

zoompilot reads the stock forward radar and shows what it sees: distance,
angle, and closing speed for **up to four cars ahead**. This gives you
visibility into what the radar cruise is tracking.

## Blind-spot monitors

The factory blind-spot monitor data is fed into openpilot. It is used for
optional safety checks on automatic lane changes, so a lane change is not
attempted into an occupied blind spot.

## Speed-limit signs

The LKAS camera reads speed-limit signs and feeds them to
[Speed-Limit Assist](speed-limit-assist.md). This requires a nav SD card.
See [Hardware](../getting-started/hardware.md).

!!! note "Radar and alpha longitudinal"

    If you enable [alpha longitudinal](alpha-longitudinal.md), the car's
    radar is turned off. The radar readouts above do not apply in that
    mode, and AEB and forward collision warning are disabled.
