# Frequently asked questions

Answers to the questions that come up most often. This page will grow —
ask on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/jFWkHC2uhh) if your question is
missing.

## Is my Mazda supported?

zoompilot runs on every Mazda platform in its support list: the CX-5
2017–2025, the CX-9 2016–2023, and — on community reports so far — the
Mazda 3 2017–2018 and the Mazda 6 2017–2021. The steering motor sets
the envelope. The 2022-25 CX-5 EPS steers to zero and unlocks alpha
longitudinal; it is factory-fitted in the CX-5 2022–2025, and an older
Mazda gets it by swapping the motor in — the CX-9 included. Every other
car runs on its stock motor's envelope. See
[Supported cars](../getting-started/supported-cars.md).

## How is zoompilot different from sunnypilot on an EPS swap?

sunnypilot can make a swapped car steer to zero, but only if you
select the CX-5 2022-25 platform by hand. That selection applies CX-5
values — steering ratio, wheelbase, and mass — to a car that is not a
CX-5. zoompilot identifies the swapped motor from its firmware and
enables steer-to-zero on its own, with every other value still matched
to your car. See [Which fork, and why](../getting-started/comparison.md).

## What hardware do I need?

A comma 3X or comma four — or an identical clone of either — plus the
Mazda harness kit from the [comma shop](https://comma.ai/shop). Clone
caveats are on [Hardware](../getting-started/hardware.md).

## How much does zoompilot cost?

zoompilot is free and open source. You pay for the hardware: the comma
device and the harness kit.

## How do I install or update zoompilot?

Install from `zoompilot/main` on the device. Every release is prebuilt,
so updates install in minutes, not hours of compiling. zoompilot checks
for updates when it has Wi-Fi. See
[Install](../getting-started/install.md).

## Why do I need a nav SD card?

The LKAS camera reads speed-limit signs through the nav SD card, and map
data powers map-based curve slowdowns. Without it, you lose sign reading
and part of [Speed-Limit Assist](../features/speed-limit-assist.md).

## What happens to AEB with alpha longitudinal?

It is disabled. Alpha longitudinal turns off the car's radar, which takes
automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning with it. See
[Alpha longitudinal](../features/alpha-longitudinal.md).

## Do fresh installs need tuning?

No. Fresh installs on Mazdas with a 2022-25 CX-5 EPS arrive with torque
control,
self-tune, and speed-dependent self-tune already on. The steering
improves as self-tune learns your motor. See
[First drive](../getting-started/first-drive.md).

## Why does the steering feel different at different speeds?

The EPS behaves differently at low and high speed, so zoompilot learns
separate torque values across seven speed ranges and applies the right
one for your current speed. See
[Steering improvements](../features/steering.md).

## Can I change the set speed with my cruise buttons?

Yes. zoompilot rebuilds the cruise button behavior: the speed you set is
the speed you get back after curves and speed zones. With
[ICBM](../features/icbm.md) you get custom step sizes, and speed-limit
prompts let you confirm with one tap. See
[Settings](../settings/index.md#cruise).

## What is experimental mode?

Experimental mode lets the driving model drive end to end, so the car can
brake for stop signs and lights. It needs zoompilot to control the gas
and brakes, so on Mazda it appears once alpha longitudinal is on.
zoompilot recommends it with alpha longitudinal. See
[Alpha longitudinal](../features/alpha-longitudinal.md).

## I switched forks. Should I factory reset?

Yes, it is recommended. A reset clears stale settings from the previous
fork. See [Install](../getting-started/install.md).

## Does zoompilot upload my drives?

Route logs upload while the device has internet, so maintainers can help
you after an incident. You can turn this off under Settings → Device →
Onroad Uploads. Driver camera and microphone recording are off by
default. See [Settings](../settings/index.md#toggles).

## How do I share a route?

zoompilot records every drive as a route, and you can share one from
[comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai). Turn on **Public access** and
post the route ID. A public route shows GPS position, so pick drives
that start and end at public places. To keep a route private, share the
device with a reviewer instead. See
[Share a route](../troubleshooting.md#share-a-route).

## Will it drain my car's battery?

The device shuts itself down after 30 hours offroad by default. You can
change the limit under Settings → Device → Max Time Offroad. See
[Settings](../settings/index.md#device).

## Is zoompilot affiliated with Mazda, comma.ai, or sunnypilot?

No. zoompilot is a community fork. Mazda, comma.ai, and the sunnypilot
project neither endorse it nor have anything to do with it. See
[About & credits](../about.md).

## How can I help?

Share drives and route IDs on the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/jFWkHC2uhh), report issues, or work on code
and docs. See [How to give feedback](feedback.md) and
[Contribute](contribute.md).
