# How zoompilot works

This page follows one drive from camera to wheels, and shows what
zoompilot changes on the way. No prior openpilot knowledge needed.

## The stack, in one picture

openpilot is software that runs on a comma device. The device sits on
the car's camera harness, which gives it access to the car's network.
Its own road camera watches the road, and a neural network model reads
it. The planners — one for steering (lateral), one for speed
(longitudinal) — turn what the model sees into steering and speed
requests. The car's own computers do the
physical work: the electric power steering (EPS) motor turns the
wheel, and the powertrain control module (PCM) manages speed.

On stock cruise the longitudinal planner's target flows through ICBM, a button servo that walks the dash set speed, to the MRCC radar, which runs its own ACC loop and drives the PCM for gas and brakes; under alpha long the planner drives the PCM directly. Radar, speed signs from the car's LKAS camera, and blind spots feed the planners. Self-tune learns the EPS motor. The driver supervises and can brake or cancel at any time.">

zoompilot rewrites how this stack drives a Mazda — and the work
keeps reaching deeper into it.

## Steering: asking the motor for torque

The EPS motor is what turns the front wheels.
openpilot does not move the steering wheel directly — it asks the EPS
for a torque, many times a second, and the motor delivers what it can.

Two facts about the 2022-25 CX-5 EPS motor shaped zoompilot's steering
work:

- **The motor is stronger than stock openpilot assumes.** openpilot
  caps its request at one conservative value for all speeds. The motor
  can deliver about 44% more where it matters, and zoompilot asks for
  it. See [Steering improvements](../features/steering.md).
- **The motor behaves differently at every speed.** Its output scale
  even drops from 1200 to 800 counts near 32 mph. One fixed steering
  tune cannot fit both parking lots and highways.

zoompilot's answer is [**self-tune**](../reference/glossary.md).
Driving is sorted into seven speed bands, from parking speeds to
highway. For each band, self-tune measures two numbers — the torque
gain and the friction — and keeps a separate steering tune per band.
Fresh installs start from a tune learned on a real CX-5, then refine it
to your motor.

The motor's firmware also decides what zoompilot may do. The 2022-25
CX-5 EPS motor is the only one that may steer from 0 mph, and it is
the key that unlocks alpha longitudinal. zoompilot checks which motor
your Mazda has by reading the car's firmware. The result is the
[steer-to-zero flag](../technical/mazda-fingerprinting.md), and it is
why [EPS swaps](../technical/eps-swap.md) work: an older Mazda with
that motor gets the same treatment.

## Speed: who owns the gas and brakes

With stock software, Mazda's radar cruise computer — the MRCC radar —
controls speed, and openpilot cannot command the gas and brakes. zoompilot's
[ICBM](../features/icbm.md) servo presses the cruise buttons so the dash
set speed follows the plan; the radar does the rest on its own. zoompilot
adds its cruise features on top of this: [curve slowdowns](../features/smart-cruise.md),
[speed-limit awareness](../features/speed-limit-assist.md), and a
[cruise arbiter](../technical/cruise-arbiter.md) that keeps your set
speed yours. Dismiss a speed-limit change once, and it
stays dismissed until the limit on the road actually changes.

[Alpha longitudinal](../features/alpha-longitudinal.md) removes the
middleman: zoompilot's own planner drives gas and brakes directly. That
is the experimental mode. It comes with a hard trade-off — the radar
goes dark, and with it automatic emergency braking and forward
collision warning. Read that page before enabling it.

## Sensors: what the car already knows

Supported Mazdas carry sensors that stock openpilot does not use.
zoompilot wires them in. The forward radar reports up to four cars
ahead. The blind-spot monitor data backs the optional safety checks on
automatic lane changes. The car's LKAS camera reads speed-limit signs
and feeds [Speed-Limit Assist](../features/speed-limit-assist.md). See
[Sensor readouts](../features/sensor-readouts.md).

## The driver's part

You stay in the loop. Engage with the stock steering-wheel cruise
controls while driving; on Mazdas with a 2022-25 CX-5 EPS, steering
help is available from 0 mph. The device's driver-monitoring camera watches
your attention, and warns then disengages if it loses you. Brake or
press cancel, and the car is fully yours again. Read the
[safety page](../safety.md) before your first drive.
