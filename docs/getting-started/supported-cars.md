# Supported cars

zoompilot steers to zero on any Mazda carrying the 2022-25 CX-5
electric power steering (EPS) motor — factory-fitted, or swapped into
an older Mazda. Steer to zero means the steering assist runs at every
speed, down to a standstill. Fingerprinting identifies the motor and
turns the capability on by itself.

zoompilot runs on every Mazda platform in its support list: the CX-5,
the CX-8, the CX-9, the Mazda 3, and the Mazda 6. The steering motor your car
carries sets the steering envelope — how the steering behaves — not
whether zoompilot runs.

## Supported Mazda vehicles

The last column is
[alpha longitudinal](../features/alpha-longitudinal.md) — zoompilot's
experimental cruise, which controls the gas and brakes instead of the
stock radar cruise.

| Model | Year | Steer-to-zero | Alpha longitudinal |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| CX-5 | 2022–2025 | ✓ | ✓ |
| CX-5 | 2017–2021 | with swap | ✓ |
| CX-5 | 2016.5 | with swap | ? |
| CX-8 | 2023 | ✓ | ? |
| CX-9 | 2021–2023 | with swap | ✓ |
| CX-9 | 2016–2020 | with swap | ? |
| Mazda 3 | 2017–2018 | with swap | ? |
| Mazda 6 | 2017–2021 | with swap | ? |

- **✓** — works as the car ships.
- **with swap** — works once a 2022-25 CX-5 EPS motor is swapped in.
  See [EPS swap](../technical/eps-swap.md).
- **?** — expected to work, not yet validated on that platform. The
  Mazda 3 and Mazda 6 are community-reported only, with fewer test
  miles than the CX-5 and CX-9.

Alpha longitudinal includes stop-and-go, so it's recommended to have
an EPS capable of steering to a standstill. On a stock older EPS, the
steering stops below about 28 mph (45 kph) — the motor's low-speed
lockout.

While alpha longitudinal is on, the stock radar and automatic
emergency braking (AEB) are off.

## How EPS swaps are detected

zoompilot identifies your car from the VIN first, then from the EPS
firmware. The EPS fingerprint tells zoompilot whether the car can steer
to zero. This is how an older Mazda with a swapped motor gets full
steering. The design notes are in
[Mazda fingerprinting](../technical/mazda-fingerprinting.md).

## Upstream support tables

For the upstream compatibility table and required harness parts per car,
see [`docs/CARS.md`](https://github.com/zoompilot/zoompilot/blob/develop/docs/CARS.md)
in the zoompilot repository. It follows the openpilot support table format.

!!! note "Not sure about your car?"

    Ask in the [zoompilot Discord](https://discord.gg/jFWkHC2uhh). Include
    your model year and, if you can, whether the EPS motor is original.
