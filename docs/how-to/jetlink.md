# Testing jetlink in the car

jetlink runs a bigger driving model on a Jetson computer next to your
comma. The comma drives on its own small model from the first second and
switches to the Jetson's model once it is ready. The code lives at
[github.com/zoompilot/jetlink](https://github.com/zoompilot/jetlink).

You need:

- a comma 3X or comma four running zoompilot
- a Jetson Orin Nano Super 8 GB on JetPack 6.2
- a USB 3 A-to-C data cable
- a 9 to 20 V supply for the Jetson's barrel jack, sized for 25 W
  (ignition-switched is simplest)

Jetson is configured from a terminal. comma setup is done on device.

Initial setup can take some time. Allow for two hours, mostly waiting,
parked with both devices online.

!!! warning "Experimental"

    The small model drives until the Jetson joins. A lost link falls
    back to the small model on its own; while engaged that is a soft
    disable. Hands on the wheel.

## Jetson setup

Paste and wait. The build is mostly a several-GB download.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git docker.io nvidia-container
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
git clone https://github.com/zoompilot/jetlink.git && cd jetlink
sudo docker/build.sh
```

Then this. Keep the `sed` line unless the Jetson is on an always-on
supply and you want it to sleep between drives.

```bash
sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
sudo nvpmodel -m 2
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/jetlink /etc/jetlink
sudo docker image inspect --format 'JETLINK_IMAGE={{.Id}}' jetlink:latest | sudo tee /etc/jetlink/server.env
sudo install -m 755 scripts/jetlink-wake-setup.sh /usr/local/bin/
sudo install -m 644 scripts/99-jetlink-usb-wakeup.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo install -m 644 scripts/jetlink-server.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo sed -i 's/ --sleep-after 120//' /etc/systemd/system/jetlink-server.service
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now jetlink-server
```

Done. The server starts at every boot and waits for the comma. To watch
it: `sudo journalctl -u jetlink-server -f`.

## comma setup

1. **Branch.** Settings → Software → Target Branch → `jetson-trt`
   (under Non-Prebuilt Branches). Update, reboot, and wait out the build
   screen.
2. **Link.** Turn on **Accelerator Link** under Settings → Models.
   Within seconds an **Accelerator Model** row appears, set to
   Cinque Terre. Leave it.
3. **Cable.** Jetson USB-A to comma USB-C. Never the Jetson's USB-C
   port. The icon on the comma's home button pulses while it downloads
   the model (766 MB), sends it to the Jetson, and the Jetson builds the
   engine (about 2 minutes), then turns green. Orange means it failed,
   and the alert on the home screen says why. This happens once. The
   icon going back to normal a minute later is the parked release, not
   a fault.

## Drive

- The small model drives from the first second.
- "Big Model Ready" chimes once the Jetson is up, about a minute after
  the crank on switched power. The swap waits until you are disengaged:
  "Big Model Available, disengage to switch".
- The path draws much further ahead on the big model.
- Link lost while engaged: soft disable, "Big Model Lost". Re-engage on
  the small model; it rejoins on its own and swaps back at the next
  disengaged moment.

Send back the dongle ID (Settings → Device), the time of the drive, and
what you saw and heard, on the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/jFWkHC2uhh). To stop, turn the same toggle
off. Do not power either device from the other, and do not pick Lebowski
or Be Right Here as the model: they are over the frame budget on this
Jetson.

## If something is off

| You see | It means |
| --- | --- |
| No Accelerator Link toggle | the branch did not install; Settings → Software shows which branch you are on |
| Toggle on, no Accelerator Model row | the USB gadget did not come up; the offroad alert has the reason |
| Icon never pulses after plugging in | the Jetson does not see the comma: wrong port, charge-only cable, or the server is down |
| Orange icon, download failed | the comma needs Wi-Fi; toggle the link off and on to retry |
| Big model drops out every 30 to 45 s | one side is browning out; separate supplies |
| "Speed Error: nan", no path at all | modeld crashed; send the logs |

Logs, only when asked. On the comma: Settings → Device → Enable SSH,
SSH Keys set to your GitHub username, address on the Wi-Fi row in
Settings → Network. Then:

```bash
ssh comma@<comma-ip> 'tar czf - /data/log' > comma-log.tgz          # laptop
sudo journalctl -u jetlink-server -b -1 --no-pager > jetson.log      # Jetson, after the drive
```
