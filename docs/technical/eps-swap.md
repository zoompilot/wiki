# The EPS swap: a 2022-25 CX-5 steering motor in an older Mazda

zoompilot's steering work is keyed to one part: the electric power
steering (EPS) motor from the 2022–2025 CX-5. Some owners fit that
motor into an older Mazda — a swap. When it is done, zoompilot treats
the car like a 2022-25 CX-5: steering works down to 0 mph, the full
torque envelope opens up, and alpha longitudinal becomes available.

## Why people swap

The older motor holds the car back in three ways:

| | Stock older EPS | Swapped 2022-25 CX-5 EPS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum steering speed | model-dependent, above 0 | 0 mph |
| Torque envelope | 800/10/25 (the stock openpilot cap) | 1200/12/12, the full curve |
| Alpha longitudinal | not available | available |

For the CX-9 2021 the difference is documented exactly: its stock EPS
firmware keeps the smaller envelope, and only a CX-9 with the swapped
2022-25 CX-5 motor gets the full one. The evidence is in
[Mazda fingerprinting](mazda-fingerprinting.md).

## What this page does not cover

The mechanical work: which columns fit, wiring, alignment, or torque
specs. That work lives with the swap community — ask in the
[zoompilot Discord](https://discord.gg/jFWkHC2uhh) before you buy
parts. An incorrectly done swap is a steering safety problem before it
is a software question.

## How zoompilot recognizes a swapped car

Identification runs in a fixed order at every startup:

1. **Exact firmware match.** A donor EPS breaks this step on purpose:
   its firmware belongs to the CX-5, not to the car it now sits in.
2. **VIN decode.** The VIN names the chassis through any motor swap.
   For most VINs, this alone identifies the car.
3. **Swap fallback.** Export VINs carry no model year, so the decode
   cannot place them. The fallback then needs two ECUs that agree
   before it trusts the car: a steer-to-zero EPS, and an engine ECU
   that names exactly one Mazda platform.

A car that passes gets the steer-to-zero flag, and everything in the
table above follows from that one flag. When the fallback fires, the
log says so: *"by engine firmware behind a steer-to-zero EPS swap"*.
The full matching design — every firmware string, the VIN table, and
the fallbacks that were tried and rejected — is in
[Mazda fingerprinting](mazda-fingerprinting.md).

## After the swap

- **Check recognition.** On the first drive, confirm the device
  recognizes the car. If it does not, or support looks wrong, stop and
  post on the Discord with a route ID (see
  [Share a route](../troubleshooting.md#share-a-route)).
- **Expect a learning period.** The self-tune seeds come from a CX-5.
  On any swapped car the learner starts from those and adapts to your
  motor over the first drives. CX-9 owners report the longest
  adaptation; give it miles before judging the feel. See
  [Steering improvements](../features/steering.md) and
  [First drive](../getting-started/first-drive.md).
- **Custom tune stays off.** The learned values beat hand values. See
  [Custom tune](../how-to/custom-tune.md).
