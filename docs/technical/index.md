# Technical notes

These pages are the engineering record behind the fork. They document the
reasoning behind zoompilot's constants and design choices, kept out of
the code comments on purpose.

!!! note "Written for openpilot readers"

    These pages use openpilot's own vocabulary — lateral, longitudinal,
    CAN frames, panda safety. New to all of this? Start with
    [How zoompilot works](../getting-started/how-it-works.md), then the
    [feature pages](../features/index.md), which say the same things in
    plain words.

The design pages carry a **Constants** table (name, value, measurement,
route) and a **Tried and rejected** section. Rlogs and the analysis
scripts live in the private `zoompilot-research` repository. Route IDs
are the dongle-side segment names in `tools/mazda_long/test_data/` of the
[zoompilot repository](https://github.com/zoompilot/zoompilot). The
[route library](route-library.md) indexes the citations, and
[Tried and rejected](rejected.md) collects every rejected design in one
place.

## Lateral (steering)

- [Mazda lateral: evidence and design notes](mazda-lateral.md) — the 2022
  EPS detection and flag, the "1200/12/12 envelope", speed-dependent
  STEER_MAX, LKAS_BLOCK and the non-delivery latch, and the camera
  ERR_BIT_1 history.
- [EPS swap](eps-swap.md) — what the swap unlocks for an older Mazda,
  and how zoompilot sees a swapped car. The owner-facing side of the
  steering story.
- [Lateral tune: v2 torque controller](lateral-tune.md) — the v0/v1/v2
  lineage, v2 mechanisms and how they are attributed, the steer-limit
  classifier, the speed-bin learner with its cache, and the acceptance
  numbers for the next on-car pass.

## Longitudinal (cruise)

- [Mazda longitudinal (alpha long)](mazda-longitudinal.md) — radar
  takeover and hand-back, the CRZ_INFO checksum, stop-and-go, MRCC state
  semantics, and alpha-long availability.
- [Cruise arbiter](cruise-arbiter.md) — setpoint ownership, SLA sessions,
  dismiss semantics, and the reconciler.
- [ICBM](icbm.md) — the button servo, actuation profiles, fast mode, and
  the restore quiet window.
- [Curve and limit speed planning](scc-curve-planning.md) — model
  curvature range bias, the highway near-window horizon, publish_ramp and
  the op-long budget, and map retain logic.

## Identification

- [Mazda fingerprinting](mazda-fingerprinting.md) — a VIN decode table
  and the EPS-swap fallback.

## Evidence

- [Route library](route-library.md) — every route citation in these
  pages, with the claim each one backs. Generated from the pages above;
  a number is only as good as the drive behind it.
